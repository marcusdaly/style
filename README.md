# Style Transfer Your Language with Encoders (STYLE): Multi-Domain Style Transfer for Natural Language Processing

This project explores multi-domain style transfer for natural language processing, based on recent research for images.  The goal is to encode styled text content to an objective latent distribution which can be decoded into different styles.

The main model is in model.ipynb. To run, it needs tokenized.pkl of the training data and evaluation.pkl of the evaluation data.
